        <p class="lead mb-4">In the past Iâ€™ve been able to educate myself through many different job experiences. I started off small by just doing volunteer work in high school and that eventually moved up to bigger projects and goals to bring me to where I am now. I would help out at a food pantry close by where we would take food donations and give them to people who were not able to provide for themselves. This gave me an opportunity to give back to the community while also being able to learn about working with other people. I have also had my fair share of working with children through summer camps where I would guide them through daily activities and some learning to keep them engaged while school is off. This has helped me to be more prepared when taking on responsibilities at different jobs. I also have two younger brothers which has helped me to develop patience and more responsibility traits as well. <br><br>

        My first job was at an old local movie theater where I learned how to sell tickets, sell concessions, and how to check and clean the theaters. At that job I was able to learn some basic communication skills when dealing with customers, and how to properly accommodate their needs. From there I have moved on to working in internships to try and learn more about business and finance. Iâ€™ve learned the basics and I have a good understanding of how the business world works. I want to gain more experience so that I can transfer my knowledge into working a full time job and put my full skills to the test. Iâ€™ve done internships where Iâ€™ve done data input so that companies can have their numbers tracked and organized for whenever they need to refer back to them. Iâ€™ve also been an assistant where I basically would plan out schedules for each week. I have experience using excel and other programs that I may need to use when working various jobs.<br><br>

        The experience that I have can be helpful for my future as I believe that although I can learn more, the basics that Iâ€™ve acquired will allow me to thrive in any work environment that I am put into. I just want to do the best that I can for myself while also doing the best that I can for whoever it is that I happen to be working with. I look forward to meeting new people, working and learning new things from them. Iâ€™m always willing to take the next step and move forward in my working career.
